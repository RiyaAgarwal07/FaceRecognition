# Face Recognition System

## Overview

Welcome to the Face Recognition System repository! This project showcases a comprehensive implementation of a face recognition system using OpenCV and the `face_recognition` library. The system is designed to encode faces from known images and then recognize these faces in real-time from a webcam feed.

### Key Features

- **Face Encoding**: Preprocess and encode faces from a directory of known images.
- **Real-Time Recognition**: Capture video from a webcam, detect faces, and recognize individuals in real-time.
- **Simple and Efficient**: Uses the powerful `face_recognition` library for accurate face detection and recognition.

### Components

The project is divided into two main scripts:

1. **Training Script (`train_faces.py`)**: This script processes known face images and saves their encodings into a file.
2. **Recognition Script (`recognize_faces.py`)**: This script uses the saved encodings to recognize faces in a live video stream from a webcam.

### How It Works

1. **Training Phase**: 
   - Place images of known individuals in the specified directory (`DemoImage/known`).
   - Run the training script to encode these images and save the encodings.
   
2. **Recognition Phase**:
   - Run the recognition script to start the webcam and detect faces in real-time.
   - The script will display the name of recognized individuals on the video stream.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of images of known individuals stored in the `DemoImage/known` directory. Each image file should be named with the corresponding individual's name (e.g., `john_doe.jpg`). During the training phase, these images are processed to extract face encodings, which are then used for real-time recognition.

## Accuracy

The accuracy of the face recognition system largely depends on the quality and quantity of the images used for training. Here are some factors that can affect accuracy:

- **Image Quality**: Higher resolution images with clear, frontal faces yield better results.
- **Lighting Conditions**: Images taken in good lighting conditions improve recognition performance.
- **Variations in Appearance**: Providing multiple images of each individual with different expressions, angles, and lighting can enhance the system's accuracy.

In general, the `face_recognition` library is known for its high accuracy in face detection and recognition tasks. However, real-world performance may vary based on the aforementioned factors.

## Future Work

Future enhancements to the project could include:

- **Multiple Face Recognition**: Improve the system to recognize multiple faces simultaneously in a single frame.
- **Enhanced User Interface**: Develop a more user-friendly interface for training and recognizing faces.
- **Database Integration**: Integrate with a database to store and retrieve face encodings dynamically.
- **Notification System**: Implement a notification system to alert users when an unrecognized face is detected.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the performance of the system to handle larger datasets and higher frame rates.
- **Mobile Integration**: Extend the system to work on mobile devices for portable face recognition applications.
- **Machine Learning Enhancements**: Explore advanced machine learning techniques to improve face recognition accuracy and robustness.
